![](./epoch-3-opens-banner.png)

Next Tuesday, November 28, Panoptic is rolling out Epoch 3 with some changes that will spice up our trading competition. Most notably, we’re increasing access, doubling the available markets to trade on, and giving out more money.

  

In the past we’ve limited our Epochs to a select number of individuals, but this time we’ve expanded access to 5,000 users. However, there’s a catch. Only the first 100 people who deposit funds on the protocol once the Epoch opens will be able to participate in the trading competition.

  
To check if you’re one of the 5,000 people whitelisted to deposit, head to our [wallet checker](https://access.panoptic.xyz/). If you’ve been selected, keep reading to learn how you can be ready to deposit.

  

## About Our Beta Launch

  

Panoptic’s [beta launch](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-sign-up) is structured as multiple rounds of trading competitions called epochs. In the epochs, participants use real, albeit capped, assets to buy and sell DeFi-native options.

  

In each round of the trading competition, the lowest-ranking performers run the risk of being excluded from future epochs, and top performers receive prizes. Throughout the beta launch, we’re offering exclusive NFTs and up to $100,000 in monetary prizes.

  

## Epoch 3 Overview

  

As previously stated, we’re excited to expand the trading competition to 5,000 users who previously [signed up](https://signup.panoptic.xyz/); however, only 100 depositors will be allowed to trade in the competition. Participation is on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis.

  

For the third epoch, we’ve set the parameters to be more capital efficient and to test the margin and liquidations of our protocol.

  

### Epoch 3 Goes Multi-Market

  

Epoch 3 introduces a dual-market trading experience. Participants now have the opportunity to trade in two distinct markets: ETH options and BALD options. Each market offers rewards, with $400 in monetary prizes allocated to the top three traders in each market, for a total prize pool of $800.

  

In addition to the monetary prizes, exclusive NFTs will be awarded to the top five traders in both markets.

  

### Participation
    Number of whitelisted participants: 5,000
    Max number of depositors (FCFS): 100

  

To see if you’ve made the list, visit our wallet checker [here](https://access.panoptic.xyz/).

  

If you were not selected for this epoch, you may still be chosen for the future rounds of our trading competitions. Sign up for the waitlist [here](https://signup.panoptic.xyz/).

  

### Timeline
    Start Date: November 28, 17:00 UTC
    End Date: December 11, 17:00 UTC

  

### Prizes

  

The top 3 qualifying traders of each market will receive:

WETH-USDbC 0.05%:

    1st Place: $250 USDbC
    2nd Place: $100 USDbC 
    3rd  Place: $50 USDbC
    
BALD-WETH 1%:

    1st Place: $250  USDbC
    2nd Place: $100  USDbC
    3rd Place: $50  USDbC
    
To qualify, participants must place a minimum of three (3) trades, open a new position on at least three (3) different days (24 hour periods), and have positive profit and loss (PnL) at the end of the snapshot.

For Epoch 3, all participants will receive an Epoch 3 POAP that is custom designed by the Panoptic team. The top five traders of each market will also receive an additional Top Trader POAP.
  

The ranking metrics are based on profit and loss (PnL) calculated in terms of the account's value at the end of the epoch.

Remember: traders at the bottom of the competition are at risk of being excluded from future epochs.

    Pool 1: WETH-USDbC, 0.05%

## Additional Information

  

In preparation for the trading competition, traders can familiarize themselves with the protocol and associated fees by reading through our [documentation](https://panoptic.xyz/docs/intro).

  

As part of our multi-epoch beta launch, we will be testing various combinations of these pool parameter values to assess their safety, robustness, and fairness for a variety of tokens and market conditions.

  

We outline the pool parameter values for Epoch 3 below. For further explanation of how these parameters affect users in Panoptic, please see our pool parameters [guide](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/gated-launch-parameters).

| Sell Collateral Ratio   | 20% (5x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH short put position would require at least 0.2 ETH in collateral.                                          |
| Buy Collateral Ratio    | 10% (10x leverage) | Maintaining a 1 ETH long put position would require at least 0.1 ETH in collateral.                                           |

### Pool Utilization (PU)

|:--------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Target Pool Utilization    | 50%   | Half of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to target this amount.                    |
| Saturated Pool Utilization | 75%   | Three-quarters of all the Panoptic pool liquidity has been used to sell options. The protocol uses collateral requirement incentives to avoid exceeding this amount. |  


## Disclaimer

During Panoptic’s beta launch, the protocol is still in an experimental state, and trading activities involve inherent risks. Engaging in the competition may lead to a loss of funds due to the inherent nature of trading assets and the experimental nature of the protocol. Participants are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct their due diligence before making any financial decisions.
